- When you work with Dijkstra's algorithm, each edge in the graph has a number associated with it. These are called `weights`.
- A graph with weights is called a `weighted graph`. A graph without weights is called an `unweighted graph`
- To calculate the shortest path in a `unweighted graph`, use `breadth-first search`, to calculate the shortest part in a `weighted graph`, use `Dijkstra's algorithm`
- `Dijkstra's algorithm` only works with `directed acyclic graphs`



```
• Breadth- first search is used to calculate the shortest path for an unweighted graph.
• Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for a weighted graph.
• Dijkstra’s algorithm works when all the weights are positive.
• If you have negative weights, use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
