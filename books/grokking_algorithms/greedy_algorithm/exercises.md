8.1 You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture
all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All
the boxes are of different sizes, and you’re trying to maximize the space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal solution?
```
=> Choose the smallest box until running out of space

```
8.2 You’re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want to see it) and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal solution?
```
=> Choose the most point item to visit until running out of time
