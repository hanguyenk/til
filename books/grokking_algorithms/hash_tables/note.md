- A hash function is a function where you put in a string and you get back a number
- Lower load factor, fewer collisions

```
• You can make a hash table by combining a hash function
with an array.
• Collisions are bad. You need a hash function that minimizes collisions.
• Hash tables have really fast search, insert, and delete.
• Hash tables are good for modeling relationships from one item to another item.
• Once your load factor is greater than .07, it’s time to resize your hash table.
• Hash tables are used for caching data (for example, with a web server).
• Hash tables are great for catching duplicates.
