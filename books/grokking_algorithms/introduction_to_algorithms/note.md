- Running time:
  + O(log n): Logarithmic time
  + O(n): Linear time
  + O(n * log n)
  + O(n^2)
  + O(n!)
- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.
- Instead, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases
- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster as the list of items you're searching grows.
- Recap

```
• Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
• O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows.
• Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
• Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
• Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.
