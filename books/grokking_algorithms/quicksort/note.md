- Selection sort is O(n^2)
- Merge sort is O(n log n)
- Quick sort in worst case takes O(n^2), in average case takes O(n log n)

- Quick sort vs Merge sort: Quick sort has smaller constant than merge sort. So if they are both O(n log n) time, quick sort is faster.
- The quick sort also hits the average case way more often than the worst case
