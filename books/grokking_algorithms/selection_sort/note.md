|           |Array | Linked list |
| Reading   | O(1) | O(n)        |
| Insertion | O(n) | O(1)        |
| Deletion  | O(n) | O(1)        |

There are 2 different types of access: `random access` and `sequential access`.

`Quicksort` is a fastest sorting algorithm that only taks O(n log n) time.


```
• Your computer’s memory is like a giant set of drawers.
• When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list.
• With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other.
• With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.
• Arrays allow fast reads.
• Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
• All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on).
